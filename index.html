		<h3>FAQ</h3>

				<h4>
					What does our name mean?
				</h4>
				<p>
					On a large computer network, information propagates via a series of logical routing decisions.
					Each successive routing destination is referred to as the <i><b>next hop</b></i>. 
					<br />We aim to facilitate your next hop, whether that be a full office buildout or a refresh of your networking stack.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h4>
					Is Next Hop a managed services provider (MSP)?
				</h4>
				<p>
					No. Though we may provide managed services on a limited basis, <a href="services.html"></a>our core offerings</a> are consultation, documentation, and infrastructure projects.<br />
					As a small and growing business ourselves, focusing on clearly defined projects enables us to provide top-tier service to each customer without overextending our resources.<br />
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h4>
					What services do MSPs manage or provide?
				</h4>
				<p>
					A managed services provider is a one-stop shop for all things tech and is a common business model to encounter when seeking IT services.
					MSPs typically operate on a monthly recurring revenue (MRR) basis, although many operate on a pure "break/fix" model. 
					Because they generally manage <i>everything</i>, business relationships with MSPs are long-term and tightly intertwined. 
				<p>
	
				</p>
				<p>
					MSPs usually offer value-add services (VAS). A value-add service is a service that the MSP does not directly provide, but resells from a 3rd party.
					Web hosting, cybersecurity compliance, remote desktop connections and VoIP phone services are all common VAS packages.
					The MSP derives additional profit from the resale, but they manage the service on your behalf.
					As a single point of contact, an MSP can save you a lot of time and energy if you don't have an internal IT structure.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h4>
					What factors should inform my choice between these different options?
				</h4>
				<p>
					That question is exactly why we're here. Your business journey has probably required wearing a lot of hats and trusting your instincts.
					Nobody expects to be conversational (let alone competent) in every specialized field. We want you to focus on your profession.
				</p>
				<p> 
					If you're aware of inadequacies in your technology stack,
					but you don't know what "good" looks like, you've come to the right place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maybe you aren't ready to establish a service contract with an MSP, or maybe you plan to keep your IT in-house by hiring a systems administrator.
					Perhaps you're comfortable managing some of your own services in-house and only need occasional help with a project, like an office buildout.
				</p>
				<p>	
					You might have had a negative experience with a break/fix company, or found that you didn't use your MSP's services enough to balance the cost.

					Companies which only provide break/fix support rely on your systems failing to make money. It isn't in their business interest to teach you how to fix it yourself.
					MSPs typically build their own internal documentation on your systems for their techs to use. This documentation isn't immediately accessible to you, or in a format you would find helpful.
					Some MSPs are much better than others, and handing off control from one MSP to another can be painful.
					Onboarding and offboarding processes tend to be on the scale of months. Playing roulette is no fun.
				</p>
				<p>	
					With an in-house IT team, you hold the keys.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">	
				<h4>
					Why choose Next Hop?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Because first and foremost, we're consultants. We help you quantify and qualify your needs and decide what works best for you. With Next Hop, you come first.
					Although we provide break/fix support, the core of our business is building resilient systems that are tidy, documented and easy to repair.
					We want you to invest in doing the job right the first time so you aren't constantly chasing issues and fixing things.
				</p>
				<p>	
					If you're not sure whether hiring an IT systems administrator is the right move right now, or you don't know how to interview and vet a candidate, we can help.
					And if the best decision for you is to hire a MSP, we can take out the guesswork and recommend a trusted partner.
					We'll show you what to look for and what to avoid. And because we know how MSPs operate, our turn-key systems are easy to hand off.
