			<h3>FAQ</h3>
			<div class="faq-container">
				<div class="faq">
				
					<h4>
						What does our name mean?
					</h4>
					<p>
						On a network, information propagates via a series of logical routing decisions.
						Each successive routing destination is referred to as the <i><b>next hop</b></i>. 
						<br />We aim to facilitate your next hop, whether that be a refresh of your networking stack, a new video editing console, or a full office buildout.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="faq">
					<h4>
						Is Next Hop a managed services provider (MSP)?
					</h4>
					<p>
						No. Though we provide high-level managed services, <a href="services.html"></a>our core offerings</a> are consultation, documentation, and infrastructure projects.<br />
						As a small and growing business ourselves, focusing on clearly defined projects enables us to provide top-tier service without overextending our resources.<br />
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq">
					<h4>
						What services do MSPs manage or provide?
					</h4>
					<p>
						MSPs are a one-stop shop for tech. It's a common business model to encounter when seeking IT services.
						Services are provided to varying degrees across three levels: <br /><br />

						<strong>Management:</strong> technology consulting and infrastructure integration<br /><br />
						<strong>Operations:</strong> dedicated handling of core services<br /><br />
						<strong>Helpdesk:</strong> end-user desktop support<br /><br />
  
						Because they are so broad and in-depth, business relationships with MSPs are long-term and tightly intertwined. 
						Contracts are on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis with projects and incidentals billed in addition. 
					</p>
					<p>
						MSPs also package value-add services (VAS), which are resold 3rd party products (often branded with the MSP's logo).
						Web hosting, cybersecurity validation, remote desktop software and VoIP phone services are common value-adds.
						The MSP benefits from the resale profit and the ability to present itself as a larger, more diversified organization. 
						You benefit by having these services managed on your behalf by a single party.
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="faq">
					<h4>
						What is break/fix? What is a proactive or preventative model? 
					</h4>
					<p>
						Break/fix is a reactive model that responds to problems on a case-by-case basis. 
						Like an emergency plumber or electrician, break/fix technicians make repairs quickly and bill you for time and materials. 
						Because the success of a pure break/fix model relies on frequent breakages, their technicians are usually on the road all day. High volume is the name of the game.
						And because all work is incidental, you only pay as-needed.
					</p>
					<p>	
						This contrasts with a proactive maintenance model, where problems are viewed as symptoms of a root cause and regular work is undertaken to strengthen entire systems.
						Proactive maintenance is often performed in scheduled downtime windows or after-hours as part of an ongoing service contract.
						Occasional breakages are unavoidable, so most MSPs perform a mixture of break/fix and proactive work. 			
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq">
					<h4>
						What factors should inform my choice between these different options?
					</h4>
					<p>
						That question is exactly what we're here to answer. 
					</p>
					<p>
						You've had to wear a lot of hats to build your business.
						Nobody expects you to be conversational (let alone qualified and experienced) in every specialized field. We want you to focus on your profession.<br />
						If you're aware of inadequacies in your technology stack, but you don't know what "good" looks like, you've come to the right place.
					</p>
					<p>
						Maybe you aren't ready to establish a service contract with an MSP, or you plan to hire a systems administrator and keep your IT in-house.
						Perhaps you already have IT staff providing helpdesk support, but need the experience to spec and coordinate a whole-office buildout.
					</p>
					<p>	
						You might have had a negative experience with a break/fix company, or found that you didn't use your MSP's services enough to balance the cost.

						Break/fix oriented companies rely on your systems failing to make money. It isn't in their interest to empower you.
						MSPs build their own internal documentation on your systems which isn't immediately available to you or in a useful format.
						Some MSPs are better than others. Onboarding and offboarding processes tend to be on the scale of months, so trial and error is no fun.
					</p>
					<p>	
						If you're at a crossroads, it's a great time to hire us.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq">	
					<h4>
						Why choose Next Hop?
					</h4>
					<p>
						Because <strong>we're here to empower you.</strong> <br /><br />
						
						As consultants, we help you quantify and qualify your needs.
						We believe technology should empower people, so we take a holistic view of your company and advise you accordingly.
						By providing only high-level managed services and working with select customers, 
						we ensure you recieve 1-on-1 service that never feels rushed.<br /><br />
		
						Our core focus is building resilient, scalable systems that are beautiful, documented and easy to repair.
						We want you to invest in doing the job right the first time so you aren't chasing problems later. 
					</p>
					<p>	
						If it's time to hire internal IT staff, but you don't know how to vet and interview a candidate, we'll be right there with you.
						If you choose to contract a MSP, we can take out the guesswork and recommend businesses we know and trust.
						And whatever you choose, our turn-key systems are easy to hand off!
